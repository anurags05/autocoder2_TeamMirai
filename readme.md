Themed Storytelling Website
Welcome to the Themed Storytelling Website! This project is designed to immerse users in a world of interactive storytelling. As you progress through the story, you'll experience various interactive challenges that will help unfold the narrative. Each element of the site has been crafted to engage you and bring the story to life.

Features
1. 3D CSS Navigation
The navigation is brought to life using CSS 3D transforms, creating an interactive and dynamic experience. The navigation menu uses a 3D effect to give a sense of depth, allowing users to explore the website in an innovative and visually appealing way. With smooth transitions and subtle animations, it feels like you're diving into the story as you explore sections.

Hover Effects: Navigation items animate when hovered over, giving the user an intuitive sense of movement.
Smooth Transitions: The page layout shifts and transitions seamlessly using CSS 3D, enhancing the user experience.

2. Browser Games to Progress to the Next Level
Interactive browser games have been incorporated into the storytelling experience. As the user progresses through the story, they will encounter games that need to be completed in order to move forward in the plot.

Puzzle Games: Solve puzzles that align with the narrative's challenges and unlock the next chapter.
Action-Based Tasks: Perform actions in mini-games that affect the story’s progression, tying in seamlessly with the narrative.
Progression System: Completion of each game unlocks the next stage of the story, offering a sense of achievement and involvement.

3. CSS Used for Storytelling the Plot
CSS is creatively used not only for layout and styling but also to narrate the plot itself. With clever animations and transitions, the story unfolds in a visually engaging way.

Text Animations: Key moments in the plot are highlighted with text animations, keeping the reader's attention while advancing the story.
Interactive Storytelling: As users interact with elements, the story dynamically shifts—such as changing background scenes, revealing hidden text, or showing new images based on user choices.
Themed Visuals: CSS is used to create thematic elements, such as color schemes and font choices, that change as the story progresses, reflecting the mood and tone of the narrative.
